// Define an enum called VehicleType
enum VehicleType {
    Car, // Assign the value 0 to Car
    Truck, // Assign the value 1 to Truck
    Motorcycle // Assign the value 2 to Motorcycle
}

// Log the first type of vehicle (Car)
console.log(VehicleType.Car); // It shows 0 because enums start counting from 0
// Here, we're just checking what number the Car category got in our list.
