## Union Types

Union types in TypeScript allow variables to hold values of multiple types, specified using the `|` symbol. This flexibility enables variables to accept different types of values without causing type errors.

## Literal Types

Literal types specify exact values that variables can hold, providing strict type checking and allowing for explicit definition of allowed values. They are denoted by specific values rather than general types like `string` or `number`.

## Nullable Types

Nullable types allow variables to hold either a specific data type or the special value `null`, indicating potential absence or undefined state. This feature enhances type safety by explicitly handling cases where data may be missing or uninitialized.

## Type Alias

Type aliases provide custom names for complex type definitions, improving code readability, maintainability, and reusability. They allow developers to define custom data types based on existing types or combinations of types.

## Intersection Type

Intersection types combine multiple types into one, creating a new type that includes all properties and functionalities of the individual types being intersected. This allows for the creation of complex composite types by merging existing types.
